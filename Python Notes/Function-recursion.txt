Recursion:-
---------------
   --->Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that          you can loop through data to reach a result.

  example,
  -----------

      def recursion(k):
            if(k > 0):
                 result = k+recursion(k - 1)
                 print(result)
           else:
                 result = 0
                 return result

     print("Recursion Example Results:")
     recursion(4)
