What is Python?:-
----------------------

             -->Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:-
-----------------

             -->web development (server-side)

             -->software development

             -->mathematics

             -->system scripting


Why Python?:-
------------------

       -->Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
       -->Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
       -->Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
       -->Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages:-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   -->Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language 
                        with influence from mathematics.

                   -->Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages 
                        which often use semicolons or parentheses.

       
                          syntax,
