CSS Height, Width and Max-width:-
----------------------------------------------------

        -->The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

        -->The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

        -->The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.


CSS height and width Values:-
--------------------------------------------

        -->The height and width properties may have the following values:

                                >auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
                                >length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
                                >% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
                                >initial - Sets the height/width to its default value 
                                >inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

     
           Example,
           --------------

                        Set the height and width of a <div> element,

                                    div {
                                                height: 200px;
                                                width: 50%;
                                                background-color: powderblue;
                                           }


       Setting max-width:-
      -----------------------------

 
                     -->The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

                     -->The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no                                     maximum width).

                      -->The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar                            to the page.

                       -->In this situation, using max-width will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be used (and the width property will be ignored).
