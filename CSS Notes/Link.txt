CSS Links:-

        -->With CSS, links can be styled in many different ways.

    Styling Links:-
   ----------------------

               -->Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).

                                     Example,
                                    ---------------
                                                                a {
                                                                        color: hotpink;
                                                                   }

            -->In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

            -->The four links states are,

                              >a:link - a normal, unvisited link
                              >a:visited - a link the user has visited
                              >a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
                              >a:active - a link the moment it is clicked  

           -->When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:

                             >a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
                             >a:active MUST come after a:hover

     Text Decoration:
     ------------------------

              -->The text-decoration property is mostly used to remove underlines from links.

                              a:link {
                                             text-decoration: none;
                                          }
