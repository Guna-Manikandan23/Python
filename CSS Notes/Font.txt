                           -->The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.
 
                           -->Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

 
     Generic Font Families:
    ------------------------------------
                   In CSS there are five generic font families,

                               -->Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance. 

                               -->Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.

                               -->Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 

                               -->Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.

                              -->Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

                              -->All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families. 

    The CSS font-family Property:
    ----------------------------------------------

                              -->In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

Note: If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

        Example,
        -------------
                  Specify some different fonts for three paragraphs,

                                 .p1 {
                                           font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
                                       }

                               .p2 {
                                        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
                                     }
