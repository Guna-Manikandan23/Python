Attributes of HTML img tag
The src and alt are important attributes of HTML img tag. All attributes of HTML image tag are given below.

How to get image from another directory/folder?
To insert an image in your web, that image must be present in your same folder where you have put the HTML file. But if in some case image is available in some other directory then you can access the image like this:

<img src="E:/images/animal.png" height="180" width="300" alt="animal image">  

Use <img> tag as a link
We can also link an image with other page or we can use an image as a link. To do this, put <img> tag inside the <a> tag.

HTML Background Images:

A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.

Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

Example
Add a background image on a HTML element:

<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

Specify the background image in the <style> element:

<style>
p {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>


Background Image on a Page
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element:

Example
Add a background image for the entire page:

<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

Background Repeat
If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>


Background Cover
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;
}
</style>


Background Stretch
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:
Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style>
