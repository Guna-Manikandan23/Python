                        HTML Attribute:
HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.

Syntax
<element attribute_name="value">content</element>  


Example:
 <!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1> This is Style attribute</h1>  
   <p style="height: 50px; color: blue">It will add style property in element</p>  
    <p style="color: red">It will change the color of content</p>  
</body>  
</html>  



Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


Example Explained
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
The <body> element defines the document's body.

It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
The <h1> element defines a heading.

It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
The <p> element defines a paragraph.

It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>


Never Skip the End Tag
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph

</body>
</html>


Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase tag names.


HTML Tag Reference
W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

Tag	                                       Description
<html>	                                       Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>	                                       Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	                      Defines HTML headings
